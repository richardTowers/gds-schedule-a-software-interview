      <p class="govuk-body">
      It's important that panels are made up of people from diverse
      backgrounds. This helps counteract unconscious bias, and shows candidates
      that GDS is a diverse organisation. It's a small thing, but it's part of
      our strategy for addressing the lack of diversity in our communities
      (particularly in the software development community).
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
      Staffing panels fairly can be a little bit tricky though. If we're not
      careful, we could end up asking the same few women of colour to do the
      lion's share of the interviewing.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
      This application uses an algorithm to choose panels that meet our
      diversity requirements, while constraining the number of interviews that
      each individual needs to do.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Select an interview panel</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
      To select a panel, you'll need to provide a list of people who have
      volunteered to sit on panels.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
      The GDS recruitment team should be able to give you a list of the people
      who've completed the interview, including their diversity information.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
      Use this tool by creating a spreadsheet with details of the candidates
      and the pool of panelists. Paste the values from your spreadsheet, and
      this tool will select some panels for you.
