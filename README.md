gds-schedule-a-software-interview
=================================

This is a small application to help find panelists for software developer
interviews.

It's important that our panels are diverse, so that we are as unbiased as
possible. This can mean that colleagues from under-represented groups do a
disproportionate amount of interviewing - this unfairly puts a burden on the
very groups we're trying to help.

This application does its best to select interview panels fairly, so that
nobody ends up doing more than they're happy with.

---------------

Install the dependencies:

```
$ python3 -m venv venv

$ . venv/bin/activate

```
